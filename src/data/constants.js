      "Developing a heart disease detection system using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Deep-CNN) involves training the model on electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to identify patterns indicative of cardiac abnormalities. The model learns to extract features from the ECG data, enabling it to distinguish between normal and abnormal heart rhythms. By leveraging the power of deep learning, this approach enhances the accuracy of early detection and classification of heart diseases, aiding in timely medical intervention. Implementation of such systems holds promise for improving the efficiency of cardiovascular healthcare through automated and precise diagnostics",
